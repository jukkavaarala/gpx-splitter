# gpx-splitter

**gpx-splitter** is a web application for visualizing, splitting, and comparing GPX tracks. The current implementation allows users to upload multiple GPX files, which are then parsed and displayed on an interactive Leaflet map. Tracks, routes, and waypoints are supported, each rendered with distinct colors for clarity.

## Key Features

- **GPX file upload and parsing:** Supports tracks, routes, and waypoints from standard GPX files.
- **Interactive map display:** Utilizes Leaflet.js for visualization and interaction.
- **Segment analysis:** Draw and manage start/finish lines on the map to analyze track segments.
- **Simultaneous playback:** Animate and compare multiple tracks at once with playback controls.
- **File management:** Show, hide, and remove loaded GPX files; includes a file list UI for easy management.
- **Playback controls:** Adjustable playback speed and progress controls.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in JavaScript, with CSS and HTML for the user interface. It leverages Leaflet and Leaflet Draw for map visualization and user interaction.
